== Description ==

Dropdown hierarchical category in WordPress post write panel or editing screen. It makes the categories or taxonomies list in a better UI which enables show/hide toggle of child categories.


The idea comes from default WordPress hierarchial post categories which looks not good. Imagine that there are a lot of child categories. After selecting child category then publishing or updating a post, the arrangement seems not pretty --- the child categories moved away from its parent. This plugin tackles that situation.

2. In your WordPress Administration, go to Plugins > Add New > Upload, and select the plugin ZIP file.
